# Parser-of-olx

My project is about parsing data from "olx.ua/". Firstly, you have to paste in the console link of the category of the advertisements, from which you want to get information.

The parsed data consists of: the name, the category, the price, the view, the date, the district and the url of the current advertisement.

All information is added to database (PostgreSQL).

The program runs on all pages and all advertisements.

The screenshot below shows the table from the database.
